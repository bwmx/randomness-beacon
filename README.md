# Randomness Beacon

An AVM based randomness beacon using VRF proofs to provide provably fair randomness. It uses a callback based request and receive approach to fulfill requests, this allows requesting applications to simplify their logic (as they don't need to poll and request for randomness).

The application comprises of 2 parts:

1. Smart Contract
2. Daemon (automated and completes the requests)

## Getting Started
